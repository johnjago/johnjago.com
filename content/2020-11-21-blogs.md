My favorite way to spend a few hours is to dive deep into a topic, and often I
need a good starting place. Over the past few years, I have come across blogs
that I always come back to. The authors of these blogs put significant effort
into their writing.

These blogs are about programming, not something like enterprise architecture,
which you can definitely write in-depth posts about, but which is not the focus
of the blogs I have listed here.

This selection of blogs has been influenced by what I personally enjoy thinking
about. There many areas within the software field, from low-level embedded
systems to the marketing that is inevitably required when creating your own
software product. These blogs focus mostly on developing software, at the level
of the programming language. It's hard to describe, but I hope it gets the point
across. These blogs are not about engineering management, nor are they about
programming robots.

I'll go through them one by one and describe what caught my attention the first
time, and what keeps me coming back.

- [Dave Cheney](https://dave.cheney.net/) — Dave writes about Go, and has been
  for quite some time. He's been writing consistently since 2010. I found this
  blog while learning Go. The posts are on the shorter side, but after reading
  many of them, I have learned a lot of the nuances of writing software in Go.
- [Nikita Tonsky](https://tonsky.me/) — The first article of Nikita's that I
  read was [Software disenchantment](https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/),
  most likely because of its popularity. Its examples will unfortunately become
  dated quickly. Readers will have to read closely to understand the post's main
  point ten or twenty years from now. However, this popular article introduced
  me to a lot of the other ones on this blog, my favorite one being about
  [monitors](https://tonsky.me/blog/monitors/). After reading that one, I feel
  like I will never look at characters on my display the same way. It has
  provided fundamental insights into the things that programmers see the most:
  characters on a screen.
- [Dan McKinley](https://mcfunley.com/) — Dan's talks, which are [nicely
  presented](http://boringtechnology.club/), highlight lessons learned from
  years of engineering experience, most notably as an early engineer at Etsy.
  Like Nikita's blog, the popularity of Choose Boring Technology has the author
  writing "I have largely come to terms with it and the reality that I will
  never escape its popularity." A good follow up to this is Dan's post on using
  Clojure all day at work, surely something that Java developers can only dream
  of. In reality, it may not be like that, and that's what Dan explains well in
  his writing.
- [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) — Though less about
  programming, these thoughts come from someone who has made their own Lisp, and
  I've bookmarked a few of these as life lessons I should always keep in mind.
  His arguments are solid.
- [Aphyr](https://aphyr.com/) — There are a lot of words here, and a lot of long
  pieces, but these [interview novels](https://aphyr.com/tags/Interviews) are
  gold.
- [Dan Luu](https://danluu.com/) — Just about everything that Dan writes is
  refreshingly clear and actionable. If you like Paul or Nikita's writing,
  you'll like this one.
- [Thesephist](https://thesephist.com/posts/) — Less popular than the others on
  this list, but near the best when it comes to depth and learning. He had a
  blog just for in-depth programming topics, but it seems like I can't find it.
  If you do, let me know!
- [Colin Breck](https://blog.colinbreck.com/) — Data streaming and with some
  engineering leadership in between.
- [Stevey's Blog Rants](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/) — A classic, more
  humor than the others.
- [Stevey's Drunken Blog
  Rants](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/blog-rants) — Even more
  classic.
- [fasterthanlime](https://fasterthanli.me/) — Long articles and series of
  articles. Seriously. You know those "10 minute read" things at the top of
  articles? This blog has those, but they are measured in hours.
- [Brandur](https://brandur.org/articles) — The place to go to if you want to
  know more than you should about Postgres.
- [Ted Kaminski](https://www.tedinski.com/archive/) — I'm going to be honest. I
  haven't read a single thing here, but it's been in my bookmarks for a long
  time and *looks* decent.
- [Irrational Exuberance](https://lethain.com/) — Okay, I lied. This one is all
  about engineering management.
- [Thorsten Ball](https://thorstenball.com/blog/) — From the author of the books
  *Writing An Interpreter In Go* and *Writing A Compiler In Go*. The author
  himself says, "I'm a big fan of digging deep and peeling away at abstraction
  layers to get a better sense of what I'm working with and more leverage higher
  up."
- [programming is terrible](https://programmingisterrible.com/) — The writing is
  more serious than the title implies.
- [ferd.ca](https://ferd.ca/) — I didn't know what makes Erlang special before,
  but now I do and it's such an elegant way to solve problems.
- [Made of Bugs](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/) — I've been using Linux as my
  primary operating system for several years now, so the bits of Linux thrown in
  are enjoyable. There are gems like [Design for
  Testability](https://blog.nelhage.com/2016/03/design-for-testability/).

That's my list! It's what I'm reading now, and it will certainly change after I
write this. Hopefully someone who likes programming will find these blogs to be
insightful!
