I spent today catching up on nearly ten days of work journal entries.

These past ten days, I’ve been intensely focused on creating the portal for buying and managing Dashify Pro licenses, as well as creating the first version of Dashify Pro itself.

I took notes on what I did each day in an effort to keep up the work journal, and I went back through the notes today to turn them into complete sentences and publish them.

When I do this, it’s likely that I’ll miss some detail or feeling that’s no longer fresh in my mind, so I want to do my best to keep up with writing and publishing daily, instead of writing the final drafts in batches.
