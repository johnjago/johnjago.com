There are two types of learning: structured and unstructured. The first is
reading a textbook from start to end. The second abandons formal progression
through learning material.

When you go through a formal course, you’re expected to progress from one level
to the next. Chapter one, then chapter two.

In the end, you complete all the course material, but that time must have been
spent on the course material. The time spent reading chapter two is time not
spent doing something else.

What’s different about unstructured learning is that you can jump from one
level to the next, and to different places on the same level, a lot more
freely.

When you set out to learn something, there’s usually an outcome in mind. I want
to learn X to do Y. Going chapter by chapter is one way to get to doing Y, but
there are many paths to being able to do Y.

When you have an unstructured approach to learning, you learn things about the
learning process itself that guide you to a more effective way of learning.
With this “learning feedback” you can figure out that certain material may be
better for learning a concept than others. You can jump to the parts of
textbooks that teach it the best. You can use any material that teaches you.

As you learn things in an unstructured way, you have the option to ensure that
whatever is teaching you is the most effective at doing so, which can’t happen
if you restrict yourself to following a single course.
