I currently have 28 followers, most of which are probably spam accounts. I don’t have the blue checkmark, and I don’t call it X. I heard it’s good for business. How hard is it to get to 1,000 followers in one year? Let’s find out.

## The strategy

Clearly, I need to do something other than nothing to get followers, so here’s my plan, which may be adjusted if certain things work better for finding a bigger audience.

- Post daily during business days
- Posts will at first be mostly replies to more popular people
- The popular people need to have more followers but not too much more
- The posts I’m replying to need to be recent
- My profile will link to this journal as a call to action
- As I get more followers, I will shift to more consistently posting instead of just replying
- My replies and posts aren’t going to be garbage or “I agree” statements — I’ll actually try to make them add something to the conversation
- Watch a course I bought years back from some guy who quit Amazon that I haven’t yet watched and apply the techniques
