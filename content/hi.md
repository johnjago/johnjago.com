I like to create things and share what I learn along the way.

I’m currently [trying to start](https://undo.studio) my own little software business.

After graduating from university, I worked briefly as a software engineer for a finance company before [co-founding a startup](https://web.archive.org/web/20220713045101/https://www.businessinsider.com/peachpay-one-click-checkout-woocommerce-fintech-payments-bolt-fast-2021-4).
