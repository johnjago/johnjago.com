My name is John.

I love to build things that people use.

I’m currently making [Dashify](https://getdashify.com)—a modern, ecommerce-focused dashboard for WooCommerce. For a while, I [wrote daily](/work-journal/) about Dashify’s progress to show what it’s like to build and market a software product from scratch.

Previously, I [co-founded a startup](https://web.archive.org/web/20220713045101/https://www.businessinsider.com/peachpay-one-click-checkout-woocommerce-fintech-payments-bolt-fast-2021-4), was a software engineer at [Principal](https://www.principal.com/), and developed websites for the [university I attended](https://www.iastate.edu/).

I like reading books, taking long walks in nature, and exploring new places.

I write a lot. To me, writing is a form of thinking. I write to learn and to share what I’ve learned with others and with my future self.

I value [craft](https://www.craftcouncil.org/magazine/article/craft-seriously-what-does-word-mean) and authenticity.
