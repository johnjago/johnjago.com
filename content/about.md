Hi! My name is John.

I like books, long walks, and making things on the web.

## Work

I’m currently building [Dashify](https://getdashify.com) to bring a modern design to WooCommerce, the world’s second most popular ecommerce platform. For a while, I [wrote daily](/work-journal/) about Dashify’s progress, sharing insights and challenges to show what it’s like to start something from scratch.

After graduating from university in 2020, I worked briefly as a software engineer for a finance company before [co-founding a startup](https://web.archive.org/web/20220713045101/https://www.businessinsider.com/peachpay-one-click-checkout-woocommerce-fintech-payments-bolt-fast-2021-4), which I left after four years to explore new ventures.
