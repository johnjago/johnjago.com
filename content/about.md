My name is John. I like creating things on the web, reading books, taking long walks in nature, and exploring new places.

I write to learn and to share what I’ve learned with others and with my future self.

I value [craft](https://www.craftcouncil.org/magazine/article/craft-seriously-what-does-word-mean) and authenticity.
