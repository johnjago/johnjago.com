Hi! I’m John.

This website is where I share what I’m working on, reading, and thinking about—it’s my public journal.

Want to reach me? I love getting personal email: jc@johnjago.com

## Work

I’m currently trying to make a living building a product of my own, [documenting](/work-journal/) the journey from the very start.

After graduating from university in 2020, I worked briefly as a software engineer for a finance company before [co-founding a startup](https://web.archive.org/web/20220713045101/https://www.businessinsider.com/peachpay-one-click-checkout-woocommerce-fintech-payments-bolt-fast-2021-4) which I left after four years.

## Elsewhere

I occasionally share things on [Are.na](https://www.are.na/john-jago), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johncjago/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/johnjago).

I hope that one day [Read.cv](https://read.cv/jago) will replace LinkedIn.

## 你会中文吗？

你好，我叫高彰！我也用中文写博文，[你可以看一下](https://gaozhang.co)。
