Hi! I’m John Jago.

This website is where I share what I’m working on, reading, and thinking about. It’s like an updating book—a public journal.

## Work

I’m currently trying to make a living building a product of my own, [documenting](https://undo.studio) the journey from the very start.

After graduating from university in 2020, I worked briefly as a software engineer for a finance company before [co-founding a startup](https://web.archive.org/web/20220713045101/https://www.businessinsider.com/peachpay-one-click-checkout-woocommerce-fintech-payments-bolt-fast-2021-4) which I left after four years.
