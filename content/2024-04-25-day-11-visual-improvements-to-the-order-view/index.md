Yesterday, a new release of Dashify went live!

The update included improved styles to the order page. The action buttons in the top right corner are more consistent with each other, and the products, taxes, and other line items are separated instead of all being in one table.

Although these are small changes, day by day they add up to something great.

For reference, this is how it looks without Dashify.
