If there are two choices to make, which one is the best one?

There could be two food items on a menu, one that you've eaten many times
before and another that you've never tried.

You might have some free time to practice a skill you're already good at.
Should you practice that skill, or should you learn a new one?

When there are choices to make, and you have decided on one of them, how do
you know that you're headed in the right direction?

There is a neat little trick that I call the discomfort compass. Whatever it is
that you're doing, if you feel uncomfortable, then you're on the right track.
This compass helps when making certain decisions. You simply orient yourself
in the direction of the uncomfortable. However, like a compass, you might
notice that the direction you are following, let's call it north, is always
ahead of you (if we ignore some technicalities). That is, when you reach
your destination, there's still more to the north. Similarly, when you do
something enough to the point where you feel comfortable, it might be time to
pick up the compass again and follow it to the next destination. You might
stagnate otherwise.

Derek Sivers said the [same thing](https://sivers.org/comfort), although a bit
more eloquently.
