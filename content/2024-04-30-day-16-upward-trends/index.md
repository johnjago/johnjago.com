At the beginning of April, Dashify’s website had, at best, 1 or 2 visitors each day. Often it had 0 visitors.

These last few days of April, the numbers have gone up to around 20 visitors a day, with as many as 41 today—and it’s been trending upwards throughout the whole second half of April. 🥳

Many of these visitors are people clicking on a Google ad that I’m running—this likely helped over 10 people find and keep Dashify active on their stores. From this, there is tiny evidence of product-market fit. Nothing certain, but another positive signal. I can’t say for sure there is PMF without knowing churn, though.

But all that is for the free version of Dashify. What’s exciting is that May is the month where I hope to see similar trends for the number of paying customers of a “Pro” version of Dashify, which I have yet to create. After that, I’ll be more comfortable knowing that there is some path to making this little venture sustainable, allowing me to work full-time on creating the best order management dashboard for WooCommerce.
