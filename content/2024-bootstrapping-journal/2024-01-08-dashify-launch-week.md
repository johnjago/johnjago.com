A month after we made the first commit to Dashify, the MVP is just about ready, and we're aiming to release it by the end of the week.

This first iteration of Dashify is a UI and in some ways UX refresh to the [WooCommerce order dashboard](https://woo.com/document/managing-orders/). It’s about making the experience of managing orders better, an experience which others have said is intimidating for new users.

With the MVP complete in one month, the next two months are about marketing and finding the niche we can grow in, if we consider this to be a 100 day challenge. Right now, my intuition is that this ratio of one-third building to two-thirds marketing is a sweet spot—we’ll see if that intuition is right. It’s hard to define what exactly is right, but what I’m thinking is that more time should be spent understanding problems than building solutions.

After coming across [Andrea Bosoni’s perspective on marketing](https://twitter.com/theandreboso/status/1744338613628801199) today, the idea of spending more time on marketing doesn’t sound that bad.

You could say that we’ve done the [minimal amount of marketing](/validating-without-talking/) before building, and now it’s time to deliver the message to more people, and adjust course as we learn.
