As a result of writing a lot for this work journal, I’ve been looking at my website and blog a lot, and doing that, I started to notice how even after many recent tweaks, it still doesn’t quite feel like home.

For me to write well, I have to know that the writing will be published in a place that I feel good about.

This led me to getting distracted. I spent the day tweaking the navigation, header, footer, and home page layout of this website.

I’ll have to write a blog post one day about the evolution of my personal website, because keeping this evolution in mind, the result of today’s efforts turned the home page of my website into something that resembles a previous iteration that stuck with me for a long time. There must be something about this style that I’m drawn to.
