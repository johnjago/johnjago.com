After quite a [fews days](/day-71-restoring-functionality-nearly-complete/) of working on restoring the ability to move order view panels while Dashify is on, I’m happy to say that it is complete!

This took me longer than expected, and I don’t think this recent stretch of days was my most focused, but I’m glad at having spent extra time to make sure it works really well. This is one part that would be bad to mess up—installing Dashify for the first time and seeing the order view layout messed up means Dashify is failing at the one it’s supposed to do well.
