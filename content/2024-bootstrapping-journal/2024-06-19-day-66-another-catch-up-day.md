It seems like this will become a habit, whether I like it or not.

I intend to write my daily work journal entry at the end of each day of work, but I’ve started to put off writing them in full for stretches of about ten days. I take notes throughout those ten days, and then when I realize they’ve piled up, I take a full day or two to write up complete reflections. Today was one of those days.

Let’s see how the next ten days will go!
