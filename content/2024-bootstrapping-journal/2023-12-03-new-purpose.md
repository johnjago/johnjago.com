I originally bought the domain undo.studio so I could create a portfolio of creative side projects involving code, like this [generative art](https://github.com/undostudio/generative-art#generative-art--undostudio), as well as [type design](https://www.are.na/john-jago/typography-type-design-3eroutuwqrg).

Needless to say, my interest in these projects didn’t last. I started using this website as a place for random thoughts, but the random thoughts were lacking purpose. If I look back on this website in a few years, I want to see a body of work that stands on its own, that provides insights not found elsewhere, that fulfills some purpose.

Being a startup founder, I always wished that others would share about the earliest days of their companies in a way that anyone can access. It’s easy to find information about how a company is doing today, but very hard to find narratives on what the early days were like. For the biggest of companies, like Google, it’s possible. But for medium-size companies, take [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) for example, it’s nearly impossible unless you stumble across an interview with one of the early team members, and those interviews may even happen in offline venues. It’s unfortunate that with all the knowledge out there, these experiences are so hidden away. A lot of mistakes in starting and growing a business could be avoided if people could learn from the experience of those a few years before them.

This is undo.studio’s new purpose: to share every detail of what it’s like to build a software business from the ground up, to paint a complete picture of the failures and successes in going from zero to one.
