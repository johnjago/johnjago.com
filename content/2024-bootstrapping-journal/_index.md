description = 'This was a journal I kept for 90 days while building a bootstrapped, indie software product with the goal of eventually making it into a business. I did this as a means of reflection and to share what itâ€™s like for anyone thinking of doing the same. To see what happened after these 90 days, take a look at [my blog](/blog/). I will post future updates there.'
