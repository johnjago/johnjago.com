Tomorrow’s definitely the day.

Today, I

- encountered and ironed out bugs with the Laravel app on Railway.
- manually tested all the flows.
- added some finishing touches to the plugin, like a small “Upgrade to Pro” link that appears for the free version of the plugin.
- made good progress on the changes to the website.
