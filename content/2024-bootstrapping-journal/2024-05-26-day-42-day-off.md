Starting this week, I’m going to give myself Sundays as a day off.

Being self-employed, it’s easy to work every day of the week, which leaves other things in my life falling behind. Some are small, like cleaning up the house, while others are more important, like spending time outdoors.

So today, I didn’t think about Dashify at all!
