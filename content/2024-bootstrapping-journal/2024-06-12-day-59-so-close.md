I have a huge checklist of things I need to do for the first release of Dashify Pro.

I got through many of them today:

- Finished the custom licensing system.
- Wrote the backend and plugin code for handling updates of Dashify Pro from the Dashify server.
- Got the Laravel app for the portal hosted on Railway. Luckily, a Laravel project I also deployed to Railway last fall made this easy, as I could reference that for how to set things up. Despite all Railway’s marketing, it’s not that straightforward.

Some things I still need to do:

- Request verification for my Postmark account.
- Update the Dashify website to talk about Dashify Pro and create a pricing section for it.
