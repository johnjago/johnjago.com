Iâ€™m getting close to finishing everything in [this list](/day-69-restoring-functionality-continued/) of things to do to restore the ability to move panels in the order view.

What I worked on today is restoring the ability for stores not using the WooCommerce HPOS setting.

I also fixed a bug related to the order trend graphs that a customer reported.
