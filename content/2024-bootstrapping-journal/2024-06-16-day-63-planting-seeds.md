Not a metaphor—today for my Sunday day off I actually planted seeds in a pot that’s been empty for a while.

It took a while to find some indoor plants that are safe for cats, since apparently many are not, and some are deadly!

While searching online for this information, I experienced one of the major downsides of ChatGPT and other LLM chatbots. Many of the articles in the search results were clearly written by them, and even entire sites were composed of inaccurate, generated articles. Not only that, but also the articles on a single site contradicted each other.

How can one be sure of any written word?
