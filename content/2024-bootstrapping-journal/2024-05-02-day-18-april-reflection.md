April was my first full month as an indie maker, earning a grand total of $0. Let’s see how the month went by looking at some other numbers!

## Time spent

- Hours worked on Dashify: **41.0**
- Hours worked on my personal website (includes writing this and other articles, and redesigning it): **27.1**

My average total hours worked per day is **2.3**, including weekends. Excluding weekends, which is a more realistic representation, it’s **3.1** hours. I also went on a family vacation for 7 days (2 days fell on the weekend) in April, so let’s take out those weekdays, as I didn’t do much during that time. That brings it to an average of exactly **4** hours per weekday.

I only record hours of “deep work” which is a stretch of uninterrupted, focused time, so these numbers are on the conservative side.

I’m about where I want to be for number of hours per day, though I certainly have capacity to work more—and to work more on Dashify itself rather than writing blog posts for my personal website. These daily reflections themselves take a bit of time, so now I’m kind of starting to regret having committed to 90 days of them. Maybe I need to make them really informal and limit my time on them. The goal for May will be to divert all these hours towards Dashify itself.

## Things accomplished

- Released two small updates to Dashify.
- Wrote four blog posts for the Dashify website.
- Ran my first Google Ads campaign.
- Thought a lot about Dashify. (strategy, the market, etc.)

## Results

- The Dashify extension crossed 10 active installs and has stayed there, which is good, as it’s at least not going back down.
- The Dashify website received 529 visitors, with 306 of those being a spam spike from Google Ads. Average time on the website is just over 1 minute.

In May, my goal is to get at least one happy, paying customer. Because if I can get one, I’m confident I can get another, and the rest is, well, you know how that goes.

## By the way

I only started these daily posts about halfway through April, which is why it’s Day 18 and not something like 30!
