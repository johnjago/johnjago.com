After completing changes to the marketing site this morning, Dashify Pro is available for purchase!

This is how the pricing section looks now:

Realistically, I don’t think I’ll see any sales soon unless someone is specifically looking for the SKU sorting. I think sales will come along when I introduce the redesigned look and other substantial features to the rest of the WooCommerce dashboard.
