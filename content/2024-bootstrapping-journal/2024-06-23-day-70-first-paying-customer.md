Five days after reaching 80 users, Dashify now has 90 users.

Also exciting news and a good sign: Dashify Pro has its first paying customer! Honestly, I’m quite surprised that someone bought it, as it only has a small and trivial feature at the moment—maybe they really needed it?

## Revenue

Dashify’s current MRR is $3. It’s not until $42 MRR that Dashify will be profitable—that’s how much it costs to run it. $30 of that, however, is going towards Google Ads, so one could say it’s more like $12 per month to run it, which includes Railway hosting, domain, and email.
