Another Sunday!

I was tempted to ignore my rule about not working on Sundays because Dashify Pro is a crucial point in this becoming sustainable, and I’m so close to getting it launched.

In the end, I resisted.

In the long run, I won’t remember that I took the day off, and it likely won’t make a difference in the success of Dashify—but during the day off, it’s a wonderful opportunity to do other things, so it was the right choice.
