Only two days ago, I wrote about Dashify reaching the 50 active install mark. Today, Dashify reached 60 active installs!

It’s great to see that it’s catching on—that people really do want a better WooCommerce dashboard.

This must be partly because of the Google Ads I’ve been running, which have been reaching a nearly 15% click through rate—much higher than industry averages.
