Last Sunday I started taking Sundays off from any kind of work on the computer.

So, I took a couple hours to make banana bread topped with chocolate! It’s a “healthy” banana bread, without cane sugar or white flour, and with 100% dark chocolate. If I were to do it again, I’d add more bananas and more honey.
