This holiday came around quicker than I thought—I ended up taking some rest from Dashify.

Whenever I’m working on my own projects, time really goes fast—I’ve always liked the phrase “time flies when you’re having fun” because it’s so true for me. I’m curious about the science behind this now. Maybe something to look up another day!
