I didn’t feel too productive today. I worked a little on the activation of a license key from the Dashify Pro plugin settings.

Working on this part of Dashify Pro feels like a slog. It’s not directly related to the core product, and it seems like each time I test it out, I find another couple edge cases to handle.
