I was ready to list Dashify on WordPress.org, which is the main place people discover and download extensions, but I saw something I didn’t quite expect.

Needless to say, Dashify is not [launching this week](dashify-launch-week).

I was greeted by a notice saying there are 681 plugins awaiting review, with an estimated wait time of at least 51 days, for the *initial* review. If there are things we need to change, I do wonder, do we go back to the end of the queue, and wait another 51 days?

This is called [platform risk](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/platform-risk/), something that’s all too [well known](https://world.hey.com/dhh/apple-rejects-the-hey-calendar-from-their-app-store-4316dc03) among people who create apps for the App Store, for Shopify, for Twitter, or for any other platform you can think of.

Why do people take on platform risk? It’s a tradeoff that’s often worth it. You get your app in front of a tremendous audience. There are at least 500 million sites on WordPress, with a significant portion using extensions. Some numbers I’ve seen are around 50 million. There are around a [billion active iPhone users](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253162/iphone-users-total-number-billion-apple-tim-cook-q1-2021), and I’m sure most of those have installed at least one app from the App Store. Your app is just a search and a tap away.

Maybe I’ll get lucky and their estimate is higher than the actual wait time.

But, 51 days is a lot of time—enough time to get another thing off the ground. If I do that, however, it won’t be on a platform apart from the web itself.
