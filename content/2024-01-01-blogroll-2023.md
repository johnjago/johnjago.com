I wrote last month about [traits of blogs I genuinely enjoy reading](/blog-traits/), and a reader mentioned it to me in an email, so I thought it would be good to list a couple of them.

Search engines are not particularly good at helping people discover personal writing on the web, so I’m excited when I find a good blogroll, like [benkuhn.net/blogroll/](https://www.benkuhn.net/blogroll/) or [manuelmoreale.com/blogroll](https://manuelmoreale.com/blogroll).

I considered having a blogroll of my own, but it would inevitably change, so I find it more interesting to create a blogroll once or twice a year, a kind of snapshot in time.

Here are all the blogs I have bookmarked as my favorites as of January 2024. The more recently bookmarked ones are on top.

[ronanberder.com](https://ronanberder.com/) — a director at a Canadian digital agency who uprooted to China in 2005 and started a company which is today a major consultancy, sharing his story in a few poignant posts.

> I’ve fucked up so many times since I arrived in China in 2005, I struggled to pick any specific anecdote. I decided to not choose and simply tell the many ways I fucked up on my way to creating and growing my company, Wiredcraft.

[macwright.com](https://macwright.com/) — technology choices, web programming projects, and artistic things.

[notebook.wesleyac.com](https://notebook.wesleyac.com/) — literary takes on society and technology. I liked [How Websites Die](https://notebook.wesleyac.com/how-websites-die/) for its comprehensive description of a phenomenon that happens all the time but that we don’t really think about.

[stephango.com](https://stephango.com/) — life lessons and unique ideas for note taking.

[benborgers.com](https://benborgers.com/) — university student who makes a lot of web projects and writes about them.

[cafe.blank.page](https://cafe.blank.page/channels/worklogs) — brief notes about working on [blank.page](https://blank.page). I like reading these behind-the-scenes thoughts. It’s actually the inspiration for what’s currently on [undo.studio](https://undo.studio).

[method.ac](https://method.ac/writing/) — a journal about design-related software projects, where I got the name “work logs” from for [undo.studio](https://undo.studio).

[matthewbutterick.com/chron](https://matthewbutterick.com/chron/) — law, technology, and programming.

[sive.rs/blog](https://sive.rs/blog) — the classic.

[paulgraham.com/articles.html](https://paulgraham.com/articles.html) — another classic.

[scottlocklin.wordpress.com](https://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/) — science and society, wordy and rambling but fun to read.

[manuelmoreale.com](https://manuelmoreale.com/) — this year he started a series called *People and Blogs*, which is about people and their personal blogs. A must read, naturally, if you’re reading this.

[neil.computer](https://neil.computer/) — what puts this blog on the list is that one person is talking about a wide variety of topics, from [overkill objects for everyday life](https://neil.computer/notes/overkill-objects-for-everyday-life/), to [programming languages](https://neil.computer/notes/parsing-text-using-dsl-grammar/), [typefaces](https://neil.computer/notes/introducing-berkeley-mono/), and [DIY accounting for SaaS companies](https://neil.computer/notes/chart-of-accounts-for-startups-and-saas-companies/), just to name a few. Usually, you don’t see typeface designers who have experience in quantum computing, and vice versa. This leads to discovering new viewpoints as those viewpoints aren’t siloed.

[jeremycote.net](https://jeremycote.net) — if you like reading approachable essays that help you understand things you didn’t before, this is the place. Also a lot of [good reminders](https://jeremycote.net/reach-out). Apparently, my impression matches what the author intended, which is a good sign:

> Above all, my goal is to share essays that capture the essence of what it means to be curious and search for understanding.

[Road to Ramen](https://namukang.notion.site/Road-to-Ramen-c3be0bb060774c8ba296b3819ac2407b) — though it hasn’t been updated in a while and is moving between domains, DK’s daily work logs—really daily, unlike the other two—were delightful to read to see how [Browserflow](https://browserflow.app/) came to be. It even led me to to using Browserflow and writing a testimonial!

[world.hey.com/dhh/](https://world.hey.com/dhh/) — DHH’s (creator of Ruby on Rails, among other things) latest writing place. Probably the one that best balances frequency of posting and quality.

[www.avabear.xyz](https://www.avabear.xyz/) — to be fair, I haven’t read this one as much, but a few posts I did really [stood out](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/effort).

> Here’s what I know: if someone’s much better than you at something, they probably try much harder. You probably underestimate how much harder they try. I’m not saying that talent isn’t a meaningful differentiator, because it certainly is, but I think people generally underestimate how effort needs to be poured into talent in order to develop it. So much of getting good at anything is just pure labor: figuring out how to try and then offering up the hours.

[マリウス.com](https://マリウス.com/) — how often do you see a punycode domain?

[www.ryanckulp.com](https://www.ryanckulp.com/) — does a lot of things and doesn’t complain.

[alexandersandberg.com](https://alexandersandberg.com/) — not as active recently, but has a few gems like this take on [how comparison kills creativity](https://alexandersandberg.com/blog/comparison-kills-creativity/).

[write.as/matt/](https://write.as/matt/) & [micro.baer.works](https://micro.baer.works/) — similar to three others above, fun to read behind-the-scenes thoughts of the person behind [a product with a wide reach](https://write.as/).

[brandur.org/articles](https://brandur.org/articles) — programming and other topics explored deeply, plus great photography.

[www.benkuhn.net](https://www.benkuhn.net/) — most “left an impression on me” posts for a single blog.

[thesephist.com](https://thesephist.com/), [linus.coffee](https://linus.coffee/), & [stream.thesephist.com](https://stream.thesephist.com/) — you could say he’s mastered the art of side projects.

[danluu.com](https://danluu.com/) — apparently the first one of these I bookmarked.

I hope you find some of these insightful, if you’re also on the lookout for good, personal writing.
