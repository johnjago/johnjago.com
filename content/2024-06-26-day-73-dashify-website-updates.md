I find it effective to do work in batches. What I mean by this is that, rather than working a little on the Dashify plugin, a little on marketing efforts, and a little on the website in a single day, I prefer to spend the entire day doing just one of those things.

This probably stems from my idea that one thing complete is better than three things incomplete.

Of course, not every situation is suited for this, but when it is, itâ€™s an effective way to work.

Today was one of these days. I spent the entire day making a lot of changes to the Dashify website:

- Publishing release notes for the past couple versions.
- Adding a filter to the releases page to toggle between releases of the free version of Dashify and the Pro version.
- Touching up the footer typography.
- Removing the CTA from the bottom of release notes since it felt a little out of place.
