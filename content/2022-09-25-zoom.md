One of the difficult parts about writing is determining the level of zoom. Zoom
in too close, and it's a journal only relevant to you. Zoom out too far, and
it's too generic to catch the attention of anyone in particular. Choosing the
right balance is an overlooked nuance in writing.

I've read many good pieces, which if zoomed out just a little more, could have
been a hit with a larger audience, without losing impact. It's a shame. I
almost want to rewrite those pieces to get their ideas to more people.

I've also read many pieces which have been zoomed out so far as to be the most
generic text anyone could read, text that's not easy to connect to what might
have inspired the writing. This kind of writing will not be remembered. It does
not resonate with anyone, and there's nothing unique that would make someone
come back to that author versus many others.

Consider a piece about managing time at work. The author could write about the
details of her job, irrelevant to the underlying lesson about how to manage
time. These details make for a nice journal entry, but perhaps a larger
audience could read it, if it focused on the techniques and used the job
details as examples to clarify abstract ideas.
