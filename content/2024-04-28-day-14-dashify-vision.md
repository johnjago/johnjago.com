Are you building a product, adding features here and there, but not really knowing where it will go in the end? I took a break from directly working on Dashify today and spent time thinking about my vision for Dashify, a tool to give WooCommerce merchants a better order management experience. The standard WooCommerce dashboard where merchants manage orders is nothing spectacular. It gets the job done, can sometimes be a little slow, and doesn’t feel sleek.

With Dashify as it is today, merchants get visual and functional improvements, with much more coming in the next few weeks. But, as I add these improvements, it’s important to have a vision in mind. What does the product look like at its best given enough time, hours, and effort?

I think I have the answer. This vision can change, of course, but this is what it is now.

In the software development tools world, there are always new products. Developers and designers like to build better tools, it seems. The one that comes to mind is Linear, an issue tracker and project planning app made specifically for software development teams. It’s really sleek. Go check out [their website](https://linear.app) to see what I mean. All the hot AI startups use it.

Jira has been around since 2002. Some companies may need its complexities, but many teams used it just because it was the only thing around. Trello came along, and dozens of others as well. Linear is fairly recent, with the company founded in 2019. With the number of startups who have copied Linear’s website (people have even made websites mocking this: [linears.art](https://www.linears.art/)), and the number of companies using Linear, it’s clear that their design is one of the reasons people choose it.

So, what I have in mind is a “Linear” but for order management, for WooCommerce. Wouldn’t that be great? Let’s see if this vision holds.
