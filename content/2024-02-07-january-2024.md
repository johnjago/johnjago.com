I’m a big fan of radically transparent companies. [Buffer](https://buffer.com/open) and [Ghost](https://ghost.org/about#metrics) come to mind.

While trying to start my own online business, I want to do the same from the very start. So, that starts today!

I’ll review key metrics from the past month to see how things are going.

Dashify is a WordPress plugin that’s still pending review before it’s listed on WordPress.org, so of course it’s going to be 0 this month.

| | |
|-|-|
| Dashify, active installs | 0 |
| Dashify, monthly revenue | $0 |
| Twitter followers | 36 (+8) |
| [undo.studio](https://undo.studio) posts | 7 (+2) |
| [johnjago.com](https://johnjago.com) posts | 4 (+3) |
| [gaozhang.co](https://gaozhang.co) posts | 0 |
| Random people contacting me because of my blog posts | 0 (-1) |

Some numbers are leading measures, which is like input that I control, while others are lagging measures, things that come as a result but that I can’t necessarily control what it will be. I’m mixing the two because in these posts, I plan to only keep track of numbers that mean something to me. For example, number of website visitors to my blog isn’t something that I particularly care about right now. Instead I care about the number of people that reach out as a result.

In the future, I may start keeping track of both inputs and outputs for fun, to see how much time put into a certain thing brings what kind of results.
