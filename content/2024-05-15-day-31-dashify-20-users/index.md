Today Dashify passed the 20 user mark!

This is exciting because I told myself that after it has 20 users, I’ll create the paid version. Dashify is now one step closer to being an actual business!

Dashify may have reached this milestone with the help of Google Ads, which I turned back on yesterday but with an affordable $1 per day limit. My thinking is that if spending $1 a day can get Dashify to 50 or a 100 users, it’s worth it.

Given the correlation between these two graphs, I’m going to say that Google Ads *is* responsible for brining these new users. Once again, I can’t tell for sure, but I’m not worried about those finer analytics at the moment.

What I’m going to do next:

- Create a stockpile of tutorials for the Dashify blog so that I can keep posting those daily over my upcoming fishing trip. I’m aiming to keep posting them daily this week and have a surplus for 5 days of posting without actually writing any.
- Take a quick break to touch up a [project of mine](https://pitch-iota.vercel.app/) which I recently discovered is used by a lot of people (need to add analytics to be sure, but it’s talked about on coaching forums at least) and add perhaps a donation button, to fund small daily expenses while I work on Dashify.
- Create the first paid version of Dashify by moving the WooCommerce Subscriptions support to it.
