When companies rebrand, their voice changes. They grow up. They adopt new, more
mature ways of thinking.

To signify the rebrand, sometimes their name changes, but almost always their
logo transforms. A change in logo means a change in how the letters of the name
look, which trickles down to and inspires the typefaces a company uses.

Recently, I've seen an interesting trend of companies embracing serifs, the
little "feet" you see on the kind of fonts you'd write a school essay with.

This comes as a shock because the industry, about ten years ago, seemed to make
every move *away* from using serifs in text. Take the well known transformation
of the Google logotype from serif to sans-serif.

Although MongoDB had always used a serif typeface for their logo, they recently
rebranded, and with that came the use of serif typefaces in places that you
wouldn't expect, like in [their
dashboards](https://twitter.com/johncjago/status/1516432612021223424) where you
configure a database.

At first, it feels a little out of place. Over the past ten or even twenty
years, we've gotten used to seeing sans-serif typefaces in technical places.
This may have been a trend at first to compensate for low resolution screens,
which couldn't show the fonts' little feet even if they tried, but it stayed to
become the expectation on digital displays.

Why does it look strange? Perhaps it reminds us of those posters from the early
twentieth century.

Which, by the way, have always amused me for their use of no fewer than ten
typefaces on the same poster.

Maybe this is why it looks strange to see these kind of fonts show up in
screens that had previously been dominated by sans-serif fonts.

What prompted me to write this was ProtonMail's recent rebranding to Proton.

They hit on a lot of reasons why we're seeing more serif typefaces in digital
places.

Rewind about twenty or even thirty years, and the same could be said for the
opposite. In a world dominated by mundane, lawyer-esque, serif typefaces that
remained from the days of Williams, technology companies chose sans-serif
typefaces to defy the expectations that people had about businesses (and to
make the type legible on CRT displays).

And what does that mean? A return to the serif typefaces used to tell stories
in books.

They're right, it doesn't quite look like a typeface that you'd see in court
documents, yet it has small but distinct serifs on two of the variations.

It's a push and pull.

What started out as unique became mainstream, so companies must once again
rebrand to stand out.

Most of the interactions we have with computers is through reading things on
screens, and the typeface is the means through which a company expresses itself
in this world dominated by writing. Since these typefaces are looked at so
often, we become habituated easily, so a change in type is often a quick way to
change people's perceptions of the writing and what it represents.

There's a lot of room for experimentation, and I hope more companies adopt
typefaces that can't be classified as either sans or serif.

Maybe the title of this post shouldn't have the word "serifs" in it, but
there's not really any other name, at least yet. In the [article on the Proton
rebranding](https://proton.me/news/new-visual-universe), they mention the world
"flare", which [sounds
familiar](https://mbtype.com/fonts/heliotrope/story.html), but alas, no one
would know what a flare is, so until it's a little more widespread, I'll call
it a serif.
