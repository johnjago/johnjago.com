My one critera for adding essays here is that they must flip my perspective on something.

- [Default to tabs instead of spaces for an 'accessible first' environment](https://alexandersandberg.com/tabs-for-accessibility/)
- [Cool URIs don't change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI)
- [effort](https://ava.substack.com/p/effort)
- [Why I'm unreachable and maybe you should be too](https://levels.io/contact-me/)
- [You donâ€™t need to work on hard problems](https://www.benkuhn.net/hard/)
