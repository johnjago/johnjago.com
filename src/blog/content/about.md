I make, write, and explore—mostly software and languages of all kinds.

On this blog I share the nuances of product design and engineering, writing, typography, language learning, building bootstrapped businesses, along with the occasional lesson to unlearn.

你好，我叫高彰！我也用中文写博文，[你可以看一下](https://gaozhang.co)。
