Hi! I’m John Jago, a backend developer who enjoys learning languages of all
kinds. I create software products with [Go](https://golang.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [experiment](https://vlang.io) with programming languages to improve the way we tell computers what to do.

你好, 我的中文名字是高彰! 有朝一日，我想用中文写博文，可是现在我的中文不好。

In my spare time, I [read books](https://stack.app/u/john/books).
