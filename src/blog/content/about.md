Hi, I’m John! I create software products.

I have significant experience in the JavaScript ecosystem — Node.js, TypeScript, Deno — and have been using Go lately. I love digging into layers of abstraction to understand how things work.

On the side, I experiment with and contribute to programming languages, most recently the [V language](https://vlang.io/), hoping to improve the way we write software.

你好, 我的中文名字是高彰! 我是一个软件工程师。现在我的中文不好。尽管如此，你可以看一下我的博客：[小笔记](https://xiaobiji.co)

In my spare time, I [read books](https://stack.app/u/john/books).

## Contact

If you'd like to talk, don't hesitate to reach out! I enjoy meeting new people.
