I write about software and language.

I have significant experience in the JavaScript ecosystem (Node.js, TypeScript, Deno) and have been using Go lately. I love digging into layers of abstraction to understand how things work, then using that understanding to build products that people love.

On the side, I contribute to the field of programming languages, hoping to improve the way we write software. If you're looking for a fun introduction to some theory, check out this [short paper on lambda calculus](http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/WS03/alpi/lambda.pdf).

If you'd like to talk, don't hesitate to reach out!
