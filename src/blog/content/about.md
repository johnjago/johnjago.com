I make, write, and explore—mostly software and languages of all kinds.

I start with problems and craft tools to solve them, and on the side explore the human expression of ideas, from interfaces to typefaces and the languages we speak every day.

[undo.studio](https://undo.studio) is where I post informal thoughts about things I'm working on.

你好，我叫高彰！我也用中文写博文，[你可以看一下](https://gaozhang.co)。
