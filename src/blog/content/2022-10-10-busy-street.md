I like living near a busy street. Nothing too loud, like a highway. Just busy,
and at the right times.

In the morning I wake up and hear people start to move about. After six, a few
cars drive up and down the street. These people start their day early, going to
work or to a gym. A couple hours later, buses start running, and most people
are out and about, going to this and that place. The sounds are more varied.
More cars, but also buses stopping, people talking, and the occasional police
siren.

It continues throughout the day. I can keep my window open if the weather is
nice outside. It’s never too much commotion. Without it, though, I’d be missing
something.

It sets the day into motion. It’s a motivation for me to get going with my day.
I hear all these people and want to join in, to move things forward a little.

When the day ends, the busyness dies down. In the night, perhaps a car here and
there, a group of people walking by. Then, it’s also time for me to take a
break, to sleep.
