## Featured

[Goupfile](https://goupfile.com/) – file sharing with support for multiple files under a single URL, easy to remember URLs that don't have ambiguous characters, and QR codes for transfer to and from mobile devices.

[Blognow](https://github.com/johnjago/blognow) – zero config static site generator for blogs, like Hugo but with a lot less configuration.

[Stripped YouTube](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stripped-youtube/) – Firefox add-on that removes distractions on YouTube.

[Timeless](https://github.com/johnjago/timeless) – the Hugo theme used by this blog. It emphasizes readability and good typography.

## Active

[Faview](https://faview.johnjago.com) – see how an image looks as a favicon in the browser tab.

[Pitch](https://pitch-iota.vercel.app/) – web version of the original [Pitch Card Generator](projects#deprecated), built with Next.js and deployed to Vercel. This was the first time I tried out Next.js/Vercel, and it was by far the best developer UX I've seen.

[Musearch](https://johnjago.com/musearch/) – search the same query in multiple search engines. Useful for checking how well your content shows in up various search engines.

[Deformat](https://johnjago.com/deformat/) – strip extra whitespace from text.

[tailwind-login](https://johnjago.github.io/tailwind-login/) – clone of the DigitalOcean login page ([archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20190113042309/https://cloud.digitalocean.com/login)) to demonstrate how flexible Tailwind CSS is. A coworker of mine couldn't tell which was the real one.

[is-am-pm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-am-pm) – Node.js package that tells you whether a number on the 24-hour clock or a date corresponds to am or pm.

[mmap-demo](https://github.com/johnjago/mmap-demo) – demo of the mmap system call for memory-mapped files in Unix.

[cshear](https://github.com/johnjago/cshear) – concurrent shearsort algorithm in C using pthreads.

## Archived

*These are no longer in active development or use.*

uSay – middle school project whose full name was uSay Change. It was a site where people could submit ideas on how to improve products or services. Like [Canny](https://canny.io/) but a lot worse. Lots of hacked together PHP.

[Pitch Card Generator](https://github.com/johnjago/pitch-card-generator) – made this with a friend for a high school softball coach.
